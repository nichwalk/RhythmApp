# RhythmApp
Final project for IU Info-I400 Cross-Platform Mobile Programming. Whenever I hear a new song I like or a song that I know but I don’t  remember the lyrics, I want to be able to easily find the song, the lyrics,  the artist, and other songs by the artist. I also want to be able to easily add  this song to my playlist. Some services already provide some of these  features but none of them are all easily accessible together and I always  end up having to google stuff because it’s the easiest way to find all of the  information. To fix this I want to create an app that combines all of these  services and allows me to easily find all the information I want and update my playlist.
